title:
  tree framework

concept:
  The application consists of trees with mixed structures separating different aspects of the code, and a runtime capable of executing simple algorithms on tree nodes, where the logic and construction elements of the application resides. The trees are a representation of an unambiguous categorization describing a link between those aspects for a particular piece of code. The algorithms are also capable of writing configuration related to the code, thus treating most of the trees like data. The major goal of this is to make it possible to modify and evolve the application in commonly described manners by the runtime itself. It's also easy to use a VCS to have the state of the evolution fully under control.

tree structure:
  representing:
    categorization of technics, methods, technologies (called terms here) used in building a variety of applications
  represented by the filesystem:
    directories:
      nodes
      namespaces (labels)
    files:
      leaf nodes
      node data:
        node type definitions
        routes
        configuration
  readme file in every directory:
    framework's primary documentation/reference/handbook
  node type definitions:
    describing:
      data structure inside the node
      execution of contained code (which compiler to use and how, compiler's environment)
      what to do with the described structure afterwards, what to remember
      if pseudocode is used, description of the symbols/marks/commands
    inheritance:
      of definitions of the same node type for nodes inside
      overriding of definitions of the same type by definitions inside
  hiding directories and files by placing a "." at the beginning of their name (like in UNIX)

linked trees:
  vocabulary tree:
    terms:
      this is the code
      code is not returning anything, just setting
  context tree:
    describing:
      input, output variable scopes
      what to remember
  routes (rules, flow) tree:
    describing:
      the order of node processing (next node)

environment (node execution):
  actual node data for modification by the execution
  a copy of node data from the beginning of execution
  execution starts at tree's root

definition of terms:
  node:
    a tree node
